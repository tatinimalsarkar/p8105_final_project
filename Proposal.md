Tentative Project Title
-----------------------

Life Goes in Cycles: An Analysis of New York City Citi Bike System Data

Motivation for the project
--------------------------

Since its launch in 2013, Citi Bike has proved to be a popular and essential addition to the New York City transportation network. As of late 2017, the Citi Bike program reports 12,000 bikes and 750 stations in use across 60 NYC neighborhoods. The program continues to expand to new locations across the city each year and provides a valuable, environmentally-friendly, and cost-effective alternative form of transportation to New Yorkers. As avid bikers and customers of Citi Bike, our team is interested in exploring how use of Citi Bikes vary across neighborhoods, genders, ages, and across time.

Intended final products
-----------------------

We intend to produce a website with several detailed plotly visualizations as well as a linear regression (Dependent variable: \# of trips, Independent variable: Time of Day, perhaps with additional co-variates of interest). We intend to limit our analysis to a one-year timeframe (2017-2018). We believe the citi bike data is a rich data source that will provide several interesting visualizations, such as location maps and different types of plots on variables of interest.

Anticipated data sources
------------------------

[The Citi Bike System Data which is provided according to the NYCBS Data Use Policy](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data).

Planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
-----------------------------------------------------

Some of the anticipated challenges include:

-   Data import and merging

-   Filtering and cleaning of data (if there may be errors or irrelevant trips)

-   Selecting relevant variables of interest for the analyses

Planned timeline
